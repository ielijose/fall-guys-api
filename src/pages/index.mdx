This documentation will help you get familiar with the resources of the **Fall Guys API** and show you how to consume the different resources.

### REST

**Base url:** https://fallguysapi.com/api/

The base url contains information about all available API's resources.
All requests are `GET` requests and go over `https`. All responses will return data in `json`.

```json
https://fallguysapi.com/api/
```

```json
{
  "rounds": "https://fallguysapi.com/api/rounds",
  "skins": "https://fallguysapi.com/api/skins"
}
```

There are currently three available resources:

- [Rounds](/rounds): used to get all the rounds.
- [Skins](/skins): used to get all the skins.
